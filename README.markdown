# Xcode

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bfoz/xcode-ruby.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bfoz/xcode-ruby)

Manipulate and generate Xcode templates. This gem primarily supports Xcode 5, but it will probably work with Xcode 4 as well. Although, that hasn't been tested.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'xcode'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## References

[Steffen Itterheim](http://github.com/LearnCocos2D)'s ['Xcode 4 Template Documentation'](http://www.learn-cocos2d.com/store/xcode4-template-documentation/),
though dated, is very thorough and was extremely helpful in fleshing out many
of the details. Well worth the cost.

This post got me started thinking about this project again, and nudged me to
finally create a gem. It also reminded me that I had purchased Itterheim's
documentation and then never did anything with it. The first set of test cases
were written from the examples in this article.
